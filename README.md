# Carleton-Schedule-Optimizer
This python script finds all the sections for given Carleton University courses and sorts them into a class containing all the lectures, tutorials, and labs for each course. Each section has its own class detailing the time, day, location, professor, and CRN. The Course class has a method to combine tutorials that are common to one lecture.

Things to do:
1) Make a schedule class that will be able to take in courses and determine what times on what days are scheduled
2) Work on finding all the combinations of courses and seeing which one has the least amount of breaks
