# Carleton-Schedule-Optimizer
This python script finds all the sections for given Carleton University courses and sorts them into a class containing all the lectures, tutorials, and labs for each course. Each section has its own class detailing the time, day, location, professor, and CRN. The Course class has a method to combine tutorials that are common to one lecture.

Things to do:
1) Make a better outputSchedule method for the Schedule class
2) Figure out a way to calculate the breaks between classes for each day
3) Work on finding all the combinations of courses and seeing which one has the least amount of breaks
