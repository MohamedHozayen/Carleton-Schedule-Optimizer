# Carleton-Schedule-Optimizer
The schedule optimizer is a web application written in python using the Django framework. The user inputs the courses they want to take for a given semester. A schedule with the minimum amount of breaks between classes is found for the given courses and displayed to the user.

Things to do:
1) Properly account for biweekly labs
2) Let the user choose from the list of optimal schedules
3) Recognize online courses
