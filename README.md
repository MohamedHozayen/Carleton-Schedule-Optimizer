# Carleton-Schedule-Optimizer
The schedule optimizer is a web application written in python using the Django framework. The user inputs the courses they want to take for a given semester. All schedules with the minimum amount of breaks between classes are found for the given courses and presented to the user.

Things to do:
1) Properly account for biweekly labs
2) Get the frontend working for the time filters
